# Web-Development
This is the single respository containing every project I did throughout my Udemy course.
Each uniquely named folder is it's own standalone project. Some of them are static websites.

Those apps using javascript can be run by:

1) navigating to the directory in your command line.
2) using 'npm install' to install necessary node modules.
3) run the app with 'node app.js' in the majority of circumstances.

Once the app is running, I use port 3000 for testing. So in your web browser, put: "localhost:3000". 

Now that I have completed the web course, I will be working on personal projects.
