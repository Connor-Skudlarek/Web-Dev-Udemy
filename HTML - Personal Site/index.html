          <p>
            I am a mechanical engineer graduate who has decided to work in software
            engineering/development instead. I really enjoyed my numerical methods
            courses, and my courses with simulations. This led me to try learning
            Python. I found that Python was really fun to mess around with so I am now
            working toward <em>Full Stack Engineer</em> to get an entry level
            position. While doing so, I plan to work toward starting my own company,
            with the intent to develop software for mechanical engineering purposes.
